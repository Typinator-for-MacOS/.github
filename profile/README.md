## üìä What is Typinator?  

**Typinator** is a **powerful text expansion tool** built to improve typing speed and accuracy on macOS.  
Instead of typing the same sentences, phrases, or code repeatedly, Typinator allows you to **create custom abbreviations** that automatically expand into longer text, links, signatures, or even complex templates.

### Key Features:
- **Instant Text Expansion** ‚Äì type a short abbreviation and let Typinator expand it automatically.  
- **Create Custom Snippets** ‚Äì store frequently used text, phrases, and images for instant use.  
- **Automatic Corrections** ‚Äì correct common typos and spelling errors in real time.  
- **Dynamic Variables** ‚Äì insert dates, times, and clipboard content directly into expansions.  
- **Cross-App Integration** ‚Äì works seamlessly in emails, documents, code editors, and web browsers.  
- **Pre-built Libraries** ‚Äì access ready-to-use collections like autocorrect libraries or frequently used symbols.  
- **Batch Replacement** ‚Äì replace multiple text patterns at once, ideal for data entry and coding tasks.  
- **Customizable Hotkeys** ‚Äì assign shortcuts to trigger specific expansions or menus.

With Typinator, you can:
- Eliminate repetitive typing tasks by automating common text.  
- Create professional email templates with just a few keystrokes.  
- Improve accuracy by reducing manual typing errors.  
- Speed up coding by inserting frequently used code snippets.  
- Save time in data entry and document creation.  

### Why Typinator Stands Out:
Unlike standard macOS text replacement features, Typinator offers **advanced customization, powerful automation tools, and compatibility across all applications**.  
It is perfect for writers, developers, customer support agents, and anyone who wants to **work smarter, not harder**.

Whether you're sending repetitive emails, writing documentation, or programming, Typinator helps you **boost productivity and streamline your workflow**.
